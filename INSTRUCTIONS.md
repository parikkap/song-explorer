## AVAILABLE APIs:

A fake api is available for this assignment. In case need more information: [json server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

To start it, you must go inside the api folder, install the dependencies `npm install` and run:

`npm run start-api`

Now if you go to http://localhost:3004 you should see the default json server page.

The following routes are available:

```
GET /songs
GET /favorites
POST /favorites
DELETE /favorites/<favoriteId>
```

### GET /songs Parameters

Bellow are some parameters you will find useful to query the data you need.

All the following parameters can be combined

```
GET /songs?_start=0&_limit=20&search_like=yousician&level=4
```

#### Filter

by level

```
GET /songs?level=1&level=2
```

by search ()

```
GET /songs?search_like=yousician
```

#### Slice

Add `_start` and `_end` or `_limit` (an `X-Total-Count` header is included in the response)

```
GET /songs?_start=20&_end=40
GET /songs?_start=20&_limit=20
```

_Works exactly as [Array.slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) (i.e. `_start` is inclusive and `_end` exclusive)_

### POST /favorites

You can create a favorite by sending the following data to the api:

```
  {
    "songId": <songId>
  }
```
